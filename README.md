A very simple roguelike. I'm just trying to understand Godot and how other people
do stuff with it.

Going through SelinaDevs tutorials in the beginning:
[Yet Another Roguelike Tutorial](https://selinadev.github.io/05-rogueliketutorial-01/)

Also checking out the [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com)
book again at the same time. Probably also gonna cross check the
[Gang of Four classic](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8/)
even though it seems very heavy to read.
